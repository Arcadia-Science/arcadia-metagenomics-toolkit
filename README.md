# Arcadia Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Toolkit

This repository contains code, workflows, and documentation for the Arcadia Metagenomics Modules Toolkit. The sets of workflows currently cover genome-resolved reconstruction of prokaryotic, eukaryotic, and viral lineages from metagenomic data. The pipeline is split into several modules: 

1. Read filtering, assembly, mapping, lineage splitting, and statistics 
2. Automatic reconstruction, evaluation, and annotation of: 
  - Prokaryotic MAGs (prokMAGs)
  - Eukaryotic MAGS (eukMAGs)
  - Viral MAGs (vMAGs) 
3. Relative abundance and diversity comparisons 

Optional intermediate workflows: 
1. Manual binning file prep
